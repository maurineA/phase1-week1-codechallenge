# Description

Is a python challenges consisting of three questions Converting a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030"). The second one is a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise. The third is returning the highest value of consonant substrings, given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces.
